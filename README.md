# SQL_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project
This exploratory data analysis project provides a comprehensive overview of a sales database by examining key dimensions such as customers, products, and sales transactions. It begins with identifying all tables and their columns, then dives into customer demographics, including country, age range, and gender distribution. The analysis explores product categories and subcategories, assesses product costs, and identifies both top- and bottom-performing products. From the sales perspective, it evaluates total revenue, quantity sold, order count, and average price. Time-based insights reveal the span of sales data, while customer-level metrics highlight purchasing behavior and revenue contribution. Altogether, this analysis builds a strong foundation for understanding business performance and customer trends.
